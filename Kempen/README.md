## Forest skid trail detection with lidar data from turingia

Based on the work of T. Kempen, adapted for turingia and some improvements for usability. Workflow is a bit complicated with changing environments.

2 different Environments are need for this algorithm and should be installed before starting the seperate scripts:
- skidtrail_detection (https://github.com/MarcusEngelke/skidtrail_detection/tree/main/Kempen/skidtrail_detection)
- download_pre_postprocessing (https://github.com/MarcusEngelke/skidtrail_detection/tree/main/Bienz/download_pre_postprocessing)
