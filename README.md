# skidtrail_detection
semi-automatic skidtrail detection in forests based on two different models

This repository is based on two different models for predicting skid trails in forests. The Bienz model is based on the work of Raffael Bienz (https://github.com/RaffiBienz/skidroad_finder) and the Kempen model is based on the work of Tanja Kempen (https://gitlab.gwdg.de/tanja.kempen/skidtrail-detection). 

Created by Marcus Engelke for his master thesis.

The given models were improved for a more automated processing for big forest areas in Thuringia, Germany.
