## Forest skid trail detection with lidar data from turingia

Based on the work of R. Bienz, adapted for turingia and some improvements for usability. Workflow is a bit complicated with changing environments.

3 different Environments are need for this algorithm and should be installed before starting the seperate scripts:
- dtmanalyzer (https://github.com/MarcusEngelke/skidtrail_detection/tree/main/Bienz/dtmanalyzer)
- skidroad_detection (https://github.com/MarcusEngelke/skidtrail_detection/tree/main/Bienz/skidroad_finder)
- download_pre_postprocessing ()
